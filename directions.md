# Week 1 independent project
## loan management system
 We all like to have that extra bit of cash when you are strapped for cash once in a while, donâ€™t we? So for this week we will need to build a simple loan management system in sinatra that lets a user borrow loans.
 You will need to create a class where your friends can borrow and have a link in your app where you can see a list of all people who owe you some money, and who owe you money.

### Objectives
- For the next code review have the following things:
An .erb file for your loans calculations. Should let you borrow and loan out to people (i.e two methods).
- An algorithm that lets you calculate the interest in advance show to users before they take a loan with you
- Have a detailed spec files for testing out your methods (both unit and integration).  
- A path for a user to see their loans (What they owe and what is owed to them separately).
